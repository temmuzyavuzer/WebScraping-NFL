The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league that consists of 32 teams. The NFL is one of the major North American professional sports leagues and the highest professional level of American football in the world. Each NFL season begins with a three-week preseason in August, followed by the eighteen-week regular season, which runs from early September to early January. Each team plays seventeen games and has one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, seven teams from each conference (four division winners and three wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament that culminates in the Super Bowl.
